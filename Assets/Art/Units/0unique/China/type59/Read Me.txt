This file contains my reskin of Snafusmith's T-55 from the Warlords Modern Warfare Mod. I have included his animations in this file along with the .nif.

!!!!!!!!!Important-!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I have modified the .nif file for a better scale and to use three textures: grey metal .dds, gloss .dds, and t55 .dds. You must use all three .dds files with this .nif for the Leopard2A5 to look right in the game!

Please give me proper credit when using this skin job in your Mods, etc.  Also, do not forget to credit Snafusmith for creation of the model and animations.
